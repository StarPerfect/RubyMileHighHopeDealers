<h4>Heroin Anonymous is a non-profit fellowship of men and women who have found a solution to heroin addiction. HA is a
    fellowship of complete abstinence from all drugs and alcohol. We are recovered heroin addicts who meet regularly to
    help each other stay sober. The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop suffering from heroin addiction.
    There are no dues or fees for HA membership. HA is not allied with any sect, denomination, politics, organization or
    institution; does not wish to engage in any controversy and neither endorses nor opposes any causes. Our primary
    purpose is to stay sober and help other heroin addicts to achieve sobriety. </h4>

<h4>Heroin Anonymous is concerned solely with the personal recovery and continued sobriety of heroin addicts who turn to
    us for help. We do not provide drug counseling, medical or psychiatric treatment, chemical dependency treatment, or
    therapy of any form. Our members consist of individuals who have found a better way of life. We have recovered from
    our heroin addiction and simply wish to offer help to those who suffer. We are fully self-supporting, we accept
    voluntary contributions from our members for our expenses, and we respectfully decline outside contributions. Our
    program of recovery was adapted from the program developed by Alcoholics Anonymous in 1935. We apply the Twelve
    Steps as done in AA (although we are not affiliated with Alcoholics Anonymous), which involves one heroin addict
    helping another to achieve freedom from their heroin addiction. </h4>

<h4>In our Fellowship you will see one heroin addict helping another, freely passing on their experience to the next
    person who is desperately searching for an answer to their own heroin addiction. </h4>
