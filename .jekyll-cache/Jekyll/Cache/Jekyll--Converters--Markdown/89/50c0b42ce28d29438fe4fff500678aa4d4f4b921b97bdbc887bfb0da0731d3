This is my first introduction to Jekyll static site creation.  Here is my first blog post in the tutorial trial run of creating a Jekyll site.</p>

<p>I’m hoping to learn the ins and outs so I can successfully create an amazing site for HA Colorado. I am currently just over 20 months clean from about a decade long addiction. Since getting clean, I decided to go back to school for software development and just graduated last week. I’m currently interviewing for various positions and hopefully will hear back this week that I’ve been offered the job with Aetna Digital.</p>
